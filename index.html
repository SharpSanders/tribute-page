        Chadwick Boseman was more than an actor — he was a symbol of strength, grace, and dignity.
        From portraying Jackie Robinson and James Brown to his iconic role as T’Challa in *Black Panther*,
        he left a legacy that transcended film. He privately battled cancer while delivering some of the
        most powerful performances of the decade, never once letting the world see him falter. 
        Boseman inspired millions to carry themselves with purpose, courage, and honor.
